description: >-
  This detection identifies suspicious post-update behaviors that may indicate
  a compromised software supply chain. It focuses on detecting unusual network
  connections, process execution patterns, and file system activities that occur
  immediately following a legitimate software update. These behaviors may indicate
  that a trusted update channel has been compromised to deliver malicious payloads,
  potentially leading to data exfiltration, lateral movement, or persistent access
  to critical systems across the enterprise.

data_source:
  - Windows Event Logs (System, Security)
  - Sysmon EventID 1, 3, 11
  - Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) Platforms
  - Network Firewall/Proxy Logs

how_to_implement: >-
  To implement this detection effectively:
  - Ensure Windows event logging is enabled with System and Security logs collected
  - Deploy Sysmon with at minimum EventIDs 1 (process creation), 3 (network connections),
    and 11 (file creation) configured
  - Configure your SIEM to correlate software update events with subsequent network,
    process, and file system activities
  - Establish baselines for normal post-update behaviors for each software in your environment
  - Map the detection to your MITRE ATT&CK framework for better threat coverage visibility
  - Consider implementing specific update server monitoring to detect tampering with
    update packages or unauthorized modifications
  - For EDR platforms, use APIs to query for similar process relationships and network activities

known_false_positives: >-
  This detection may generate false positives in the following scenarios:
  - Legitimate software updates that include new features requiring additional network connectivity
  - Software that performs expected post-update verification or telemetry activities
  - Update services that download additional components after the initial update
  - Automated software testing tools running after updates
  - To reduce false positives, baseline normal post-update behavior for each application
    and enhance the detection with allowlisted destinations and processes associated with
    legitimate update procedures.
