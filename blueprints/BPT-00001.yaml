  This blueprint addresses the threat of supply chain attacks through compromised software updates.
  Threat actors target software vendors and compromise their build or distribution infrastructure to
  inject malicious code into legitimate software updates. When organizations install these
  compromised updates, backdoors or other malware are deployed across their environments,
  giving attackers persistent access to victim networks at scale.

narrative: >-
 Supply chain attacks targeting software update mechanisms represent a sophisticated 
 threat vector that has evolved significantly in recent years. These attacks exploit the 
 trust relationship between software vendors and their customers, allowing attackers to 
 bypass traditional security controls by leveraging legitimate software distribution channels.
 
 Historically, supply chain attacks were relatively rare due to the resources and access 
 required. However, the SolarWinds incident in 2020 demonstrated that sophisticated threat 
 actors are willing to invest significant resources into these operations due to their 
 high-impact potential. The attack involved compromising SolarWinds' build infrastructure to 
 inject malicious code into Orion software updates, affecting approximately 18,000 organizations.
 
 The technical execution of these attacks typically involves:
 1. Initial compromise of the vendor's development or build environment
 2. Injection of malicious code into the software before compilation/building
 3. Bypassing code signing or other integrity verification mechanisms
 4. Distribution through legitimate update channels
 5. Post-compromise activities leveraging the backdoored software
 
 The impact on organizations can be severe, including:
 - Widespread unauthorized access across entire networks
 - Data exfiltration of sensitive information
 - Deployment of additional malware
 - Lateral movement to high-value systems
 - Potential for persistent access over extended periods
 
 The current threat landscape shows an increase in supply chain attacks, with both 
 nation-state actors and criminal groups adopting these techniques. Notable examples 
 beyond SolarWinds include the Kaseya VSA attack, NotPetya distribution via compromised 
 MeDoc updates, and the CCleaner compromise.
 
 Recommended defensive strategies include:
 - Implementing vendor security assessment processes
 - Deploying software update integrity verification
 - Establishing network segmentation for update servers
 - Implementing application allowlisting
 - Employing behavior-based detection for post-compromise activities
 - Developing incident response plans specific to supply chain compromises
 - Creating an inventory of critical software and dependencies
