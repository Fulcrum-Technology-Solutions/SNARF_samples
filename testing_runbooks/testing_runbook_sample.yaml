# Test Procedure
procedure:
  pre_test_setup: |
    ### Environment Preparation
    1. Verify test environment isolation
       ```bash
       # Validate network segmentation
       ping -c 3 prod-server-1
       # Should return no response
       ```
    
    2. Configure software update infrastructure
       ```bash
       # Set up update server
       ./setup_update_server.sh
       # Configure client systems to use test update server
       ./configure_clients.sh
       ```
    
    3. Verify logging and monitoring
       ```bash
       # Validate log forwarding
       ./test_log_forwarding.sh
       # Confirm EDR connectivity
       ./validate_edr_connectivity.sh
       ```
    
    4. Create baseline measurements
       ```bash
       # Record normal update behavior
       ./capture_baseline_update.sh
       ```

    ### Test Steps
    1. Update Server Compromise Simulation
       * Simulate attacker access to update infrastructure
       * Modify update package with benign test code
       * Deploy modified update to test clients
       ```bash
       # Compromise update server
       ./simulate_server_compromise.sh
       # Create modified update package
       ./create_test_package.sh --simulate-backdoor
       # Deploy update to clients
       ./deploy_test_update.sh
       ```
    
    2. Post-Update Behavior Simulation
       * Execute benign commands that mimic malicious post-update behavior
       * Simulate command and control communications
       * Perform mock data exfiltration
       ```bash
       # Execute post-update behaviors
       ./simulate_post_update_behavior.sh --c2-simulation
       # Perform mock lateral movement
       ./simulate_lateral_movement.sh
       # Simulate data exfiltration
       ./mock_data_exfil.sh --size 10MB
       ```
    
    3. Alert Verification
       * Check SIEM for triggered alerts
       * Verify EDR detection of suspicious behaviors
       * Validate network traffic alerts
       ```bash
       # Query SIEM for alerts
       ./check_siem_alerts.sh --timeframe "last 1 hour"
       # Verify EDR detections
       ./query_edr_alerts.sh
       ```

    ### Known Issues and Solutions
    1. Issue: Test update packages not properly detected
       * Solution: Verify that the simulated malicious behaviors are sufficiently similar to real-world techniques
       * Verification: Review detection rules and adjust test parameters
    
    2. Issue: False positives in negative testing
       * Solution: Tune detection thresholds based on test results
