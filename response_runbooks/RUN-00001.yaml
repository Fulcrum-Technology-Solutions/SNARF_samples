# Overview Section
overview:
  summary: >-
    This runbook provides structured guidance for responding to potential 
    supply chain compromises involving trusted software update channels. 
    It should be initiated when detection systems identify suspicious 
    behaviors following software updates or when external threat intelligence 
    indicates a possible compromise of a vendor's update infrastructure.
  
  objective: >-
    Identify affected systems, contain the compromise, eradicate malicious 
    components, recover normal operations, and gather evidence for further 
    analysis while minimizing business impact.
  
  trigger_conditions:
    - Alert from DET-00001 (Anomalous Behavior Following Software Update)
    - External notification from vendor about compromise
    - Threat intelligence indicating compromise of software in your environment
    - Multiple systems exhibiting similar suspicious behaviors after updates
  
  severity_matrix: |
    | Severity | Conditions |
    |----------|------------|
    | High     | - Critical infrastructure affected<br/>- Evidence of active data exfiltration<br/>- Sensitive data/systems impacted |
    | Medium   | - Limited scope of affected systems<br/>- No evidence of data exfiltration<br/>- Non-critical systems affected |
    | Low      | - Isolated incident<br/>- Update can be rolled back easily<br/>- No suspicious post-compromise activity observed |

# Procedure Section
procedure:
  pre_steps: |
    ### Before You Begin
    1. Verify alert fidelity and review detection details
    2. Establish an incident response bridge/call
    3. Create incident ticket in tracking system
    4. Notify incident response team members
    5. Identify potentially affected software and systems

  investigation_steps: |
    ### Investigation Process
    1. Triage and Scoping
       * Identify all systems with the affected software installed
       * Determine when updates were applied across the environment
       * Establish a timeline of suspicious activities
       * Assess the potential scope of compromise
    
    2. Evidence Collection
       * Acquire memory samples from representative affected systems
       * Collect relevant logs (EDR, Windows Event, network)
       * Capture network traffic from affected systems
       * Preserve update package for analysis if available
       > Important: Preserve forensic evidence before containment actions
    
    3. Analysis
       * Examine collected evidence for indicators of compromise
       * Identify any post-compromise activities (lateral movement, data exfiltration)
       * Analyze update package for malicious components
       * Compare observed behaviors with known supply chain TTPs
    
    4. Determine Impact
       * Identify sensitive data potentially accessed
       * Evaluate business impact of affected systems
       * Assess likelihood of persistent access mechanisms
       * Determine regulatory reporting requirements

  decision_points: |
    ### Decision Matrix
    1. If malicious activity confirmed:
       - Implement full containment measures
       - Escalate to senior leadership
       - Consider external incident response assistance
       - Proceed to eradication phase
    
    2. If indicators inconclusive:
       - Implement precautionary containment
       - Continue evidence gathering
       - Expand scope of investigation
       - Consider vendor notification
    
    3. If false positive confirmed:
       - Document findings
       - Tune detection rule
       - Return systems to normal operations
       - Close incident

  escalation_criteria: |
    ### Escalation Guidelines
    * Escalate to CISO and Legal if:
      - Confirmed data exfiltration
      - Critical systems compromised
      - Potential regulatory reporting required
      - Multiple customers/partners potentially affected
    
    * Escalate to external IR team if:
      - Internal resources insufficient
      - Sophisticated adversary techniques observed
      - Widespread compromise detected
      - Nation-state indicators present
