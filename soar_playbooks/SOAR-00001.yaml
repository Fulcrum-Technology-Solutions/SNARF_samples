# Overview
overview:
  description: >-
    This SOAR playbook automates the initial response to suspected supply chain 
    compromises through software updates. It coordinates data collection, 
    containment actions, and enrichment processes across multiple security tools
    to accelerate response and minimize impact. This playbook is designed to work
    in conjunction with human analysts following RUN-00001 procedures.
  
  trigger_events:
    - Alert from DET-00001 (Anomalous Behavior Following Software Update)
    - Multiple systems exhibiting similar post-update network connections
    - Threat intelligence feed match for known supply chain compromise indicators
    - Vendor notification via API or email about compromised updates
